# Trusted Vendors Portal – Full-Stack Assignment

## Objective
Welcome to your application assessment assignment. This is a chance for you to show us your coding and problem solving skills.
You are applying for a fullstack position so this assignment requires you to solve both frontend and backend challenges.

Nobody expects anyone to know everything so if a particular assignment is outside of your realm of experience, 
you may either skip it or propose a solution aligned with your experience.. 

In this repository, you'll find a basic demo implementation of the **Trusted Vendor Portal** application. 
Your task is to enhance and deploy this application by completing specific requirements listed below.

The system currently allows users to:
- Register a vendor (name, contact person, email, partner type [Supplier/Partner])
- View a list of registered vendors

---
## Vendor Object Example
    {
      "id": "1",
      "name": "Acme Freight",
      "contact_person": "John Doe",
      "email": "john.doe@acme.com",
      "partner_type": "Supplier" 
    }

## Existing Implementation

The repository contains:
- A Vue.js frontend application
- Two backend implementations (choose one):
  - Java (Spring Boot)
  - Node.js (TypeScript)

## Available Backends
You may choose which backend implementation to work with:

### Java (Spring Boot)
- Located in the `backend-java` directory
- Uses H2 in-memory database
- Includes basic create and list operations

### Node.js (TypeScript)
- Located in the `backend-node` directory 
- Uses SQLite database
- Includes basic create and list operations

## Your Tasks

### 1. Delete vendor
- Implement a delete functionality to allow users to remove vendor entries from the system
- Include a confirmation dialog before deletion to prevent accidental removal.
- Update both frontend and your chosen backend to support this feature

### 2. Fix the UI bug
- Currently, clicking the "Add" button multiple times before the form resets can result in duplicate vendor entries.
- Prevent this behavior to improve the form UX

### 3. Unique Emails
- Ensure that vendor emails are unique across the system. If a user tries to register a vendor with a duplicate email, they should be informed of the conflict. 
  Think about where this logic should live and how the constraint is best enforced (frontend, backend, data storage or all) and justify your approach
- Document your reasoning

### 4. Containerization & Deployment (Optional)
At maerks we host most of our backend services using pods and k8. If you have experience or find the challenge interesting, give this assignment a go.

Choose one of the following deployment approaches:

#### Option A: Docker Compose
- Containerize your chosen backend using Docker
- Create a Docker Compose configuration to run the entire system (frontend + backend)
- Include clear instructions to build and start the application

#### Option B (Advanced): Kubernetes/Minikube Deployment
- Create Kubernetes manifests (YAML files) for both frontend and your chosen backend
- Ensure services can discover and communicate (e.g., using `ClusterIP`)
- Use **Minikube** to test locally
- Provide clear documentation or scripts to:
  - Build and push Docker images to Minikube's Docker daemon
  - Apply Kubernetes configs to start the app

You're welcome to make UX improvements or add minor enhancements, as long as the core requirements are clearly addressed.

## Evaluation Criteria
- **Code clarity & organisation** – Is the code readable, modular, testable and well-structured?
- **Testing** - How did you use testing to support your development efforts
- **Full-stack ownership** – Can you deliver a cohesive, working system with the required enhancements?
- **Pragmatism** – Did you make thoughtful decisions and sensible trade-offs?
- **DevOps awareness** – Is the system easy to build, run, and maintain?
- **Deployment quality** – If completed, is your containerization strategy practical, reproducible, and well-documented?"
